Task: You are a human mobility trajectory behavior anomaly detector. Given a historical human trajectory information, via comparing his trajetory with that of other people, can you analyse the pattern behind the trajectory and give an anomaly score (from 0 to 1, where larger value indicates more abnormal) of this userâ€™s behavior?

Description of input trajectory data: A temporal sequence of visited place points, each place is consisted of the visited timestamp and its type of location. Then the straight line distance to next location is given.

Here is the segmented sequence of one trajector: {trajectory}

Give your anomaly score for this trajectory. The last sentence must be: So the trajectory score is x. Replace x with your score.
